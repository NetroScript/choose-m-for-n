This uses the [PCG 32-bit PRNG](https://www.pcg-random.org/index.html).

This applications allows you to set multiple values. Including the seed used, the amount of choices available, and how many of those choices you want to select.

Additionally there is an option to generate groups of random numbers, where one group can have a maximum of one assigned number.
